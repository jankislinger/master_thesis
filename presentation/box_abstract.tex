Fare price optimization is a modification of well-known \emph{Newsboy problem}. In this case, the inventory level (number of seats in the train) is fixed and the decision variables are prices for individual routes. It is a problem with endogenous uncertainty because the demand for train tickets depends on their price. Another distinction of this problem is that there is a rivalry between customers that are not necessarily traveling on the same route. Actual capacity for each route is, therefore, random and dependent with demand for tickets for other routes.
We assume that the occupancy of the train follows inhomogeneous Markov process for which the transition intensities depend on chosen prices. We find the optimum using Markov decision process where the price is the decision.
