\textbf{Discrete decision times.}
The original problem is to find an optimum policy, a function that returns for each state of occupation and time optimum price. We simplify the problem by setting fixed times of decision. The problem is reduced to multistage stochastic optimization. Denote these decision times by $T_0, ..., T_{n-1}$.

\textbf{Single ticket type.}
The other simplification reduces passengers to single type and allows only one passenger per ticket. The reduction of number of passenger types does not violate our assumptions if the prices for different passenger types are fixed at the same ratio to the full-price passenger type (e.g. senior ticket is always worth 60\% of adult ticket for the same route). The simplification for number of passengers is used so that we do not need to estimate the distribution of number of passengers per one ticket. The distribution would be dependent on both time and price. These simplifications imply that $\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{M} = \{ 1 \}$.
