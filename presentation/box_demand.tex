Let us assume that the demand for ticket of type $c \in \mathcal{C}$ for route $(k,l) \in \mathcal{R}$ follows inhomogeneous Poisson process and the intensity follows log-linear model with
\begin{multline*}
	\log \left( \lambda_{k,l,c} (p, t; \m{\beta}) \right) = \\
	\beta_{1,k,l,c} + \beta_{2,k,l,c} \log (p) + \beta_{3,k,l,c} t + \beta_{4,k,l,c} t \log (p).
\end{multline*}

The price elasticity of the demand for such model is constant in price and linear in time, i.e.
\[
	\frac{\partial \lambda_{k,l,c} (p,t; \m{\beta}_{k,l,c})}{\partial p} \frac{p}{\lambda_{k,l,c} (p,t)} = \beta_{2,k,l,c} + \beta_{4,k,l,c} t.
\]

Cumulative intensity of demand (and expected number of tickets sold at time $t$ with unlimited seat availability) is given by
\[
 \Lambda_{k,l,c} (p, t; \m{\beta}) = \frac { \lambda_{k,l,c} (p, t; \m{\beta}) } { \beta_{1,k,l,c} + \beta_{2,k,l,c} \log (p) }.
\]
