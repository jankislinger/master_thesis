The problem is computationally unsolvable because of the number of states. The distribution of the process at given time cannot be calculated and stored in memory of a PC. One solution is to estimate the optimum using simulated optimization. We propose two methods for finding the optimum -- response surface and cross entropy for noisy optimization. Both of them are described for single-stage optimization. The reader can easily generalize these algorithms for multistage optimization.
